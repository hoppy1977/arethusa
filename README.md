# arethusa
Arduino code for the Arethusa watering system.

## Powering the System
The hardware must be powered by a 12V power 'wall-wart' to ensure there is enough power to drive the pump.

## Operation
The system will deploy a small dose of water to the target plant/s at the interval specified by the potentiometer.<br>
The interval is measured in hours, and can be any value from 1 hour to 72 hours (3 days).<br>
The time remaining until the next dose is indicated by the dots on the LCD.
